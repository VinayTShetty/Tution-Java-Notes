private Modifier Brief OverView
*******************************
The access level of a private modifier is only within the class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.



Encapsulation
*************
Binding of data and corresponding methods into a single unit is called Encapsulation .

In Java, encapsulation is achieved by declaring the instance variables of a class as private,
which means they can only be accessed within the class.

To allow outside access to the instance variables, public methods called getters and setters are defined.
